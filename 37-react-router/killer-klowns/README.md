# React Router Library

## Browser Router

    - event listener, but for your browser URL

## Route

    - conditional for what to do based on your browser URL

## Switch

    - when `if/else` gets too complex we use `switch/case` statements => this is what `Switch` is

## Link

    - we use `Link` to link things to other things
